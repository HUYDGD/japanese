# Japanese Learning Resources
The best free resources that I personally use (or used) for learning Japanese. 


## Tools

### Learning

* [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/): spaced repetition flashcards app for learning vocab
* [WaniKani](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1609000301): great at first for learning kanji and words, but not very good when you reach intermediate level
* [Tae Kim's Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar): good way to learn Japanese grammar

### Reading

* [Yomichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/): web browser extension for translating unknown words in web pages
  * it can be linked to Anki with AnkiConnect to generate flashcards of the words you can't read (see [here](https://animecards.site/yomichansetup/))
  * can be used to read books since .epub ebooks contain .html files
  * the dictionaries I use can be found in the ["Dictionaries" folder](https://github.com/IgrecL/Japanese-Learning-Resources/tree/main/Dictionaries) (other dictionaries can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tTdLppnqMfVC5otPlX_cs4ixlIgjv_lH))
* [Hibiscus](http://read.hibiscus.moe/): .epub online reader implementing vertical reading like in real Japanese books
* [Jidoujisho](https://github.com/lrorpilla/jidoujisho): Android app to read books with translation like Yomichan, also with Anki integration
* [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro): a very efficient OCR tool to turn manga pages into .html files you can look up with Yomichan

[Mokuro.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99618877/197377340-e298d29b-0657-4340-95dc-33b06c484500.webm)

### Listening

* [Jidoujisho](https://github.com/lrorpilla/jidoujisho): can also be used to watch videos with translatable subtitles and Anki integration

### Dictionaries

* [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): rich Japanese-English dictionary

* [JapanDict](https://www.japandict.com/): dictionary and details on kanji
* [日仏辞典](https://www.dictionnaire-japonais.com/): Japanese-French dictionary


## Reading & listening material

### General

* [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/librarymain.html): richest source of immersion material
* [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/): biggest torrent site for anime, manga, light novels and dramas

### Subtitles

Japanese subtitles for specific shows can be really hard to find or even unavailable (e.g. Ashita no Joe). If what you are looking for can't be found in theses lists, it probably doesn't exist.

* [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F): updated collection
* [Itazuraneko Subtitles](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/sub.html): old but very rich collection
* [Tatsumoto's List](https://gist.github.com/tatsumoto-ren/78ba4e5b7c53c7ed2c987015fa05cc2b): list of subtitles collections (Tatsumoto's Guide)
* [Netflix](https://mega.nz/folder/2H4CFQYR#bd9LHl9VOqdT3crrJa0Axw): very long list of subtitles ripped from Netflix
* [Japanese Movies](https://github.com/eurusdagr/Japanese-Movies-Subtitles): subtitles for Japanese movies, ordered by directors

### Anime streaming websites

I personally never use streaming websites for learning. Downloading what you consume makes learning easier, as you can use all kinds of tools that only work on files on your computer. However, I used to do so at first, so here are the best ones:

* [Animelon](https://animelon.com/): Japanese and English subtitles available
* [B9GOOD](http://b9good.com/): raw anime online

### Manga

Reading raw manga is pretty hard, but you can use tools such as Mokuro and Yomichan to make it achievable earlier.
* [Itazuraneko Manga](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/manga.html): a lot of raw manga
* [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi): you can bulk download japanes manga through Tachiyomi and export them to your computer afterwards

### Books

In my opinion, reading books is the best way to enhance your understanding of Japanese grammar and to learn a lot of words. Unlike reading manga, you don't get extra information from the drawings, and the sentences are more advanced and formal. The good news is that books are way easier to find than anime subtitles.

I recommend having an English translation of the book you're reading, alongside the Japanese version. Advanced Japanese syntax can be quite confusing, and you may think you understood the meaning of a sentence when in reality you mistook a grammatical form for another.

* [Z-Lib](https://z-lib.org/): biggest online library (not only Japanese)
* [Itazuraneko Books](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/shousetu.html): all kinds of Japanese books
* [Imperial Library](http://kx5thpx2olielkihfyo4jgjqfb7zx7wxr3sd4xzt26ochei4m6f7tayd.onion/): if Z-Lib is down

### TV

I rarely watch TV but there are lots of way to do it.

* [AS Stream](https://aqstream.com/): simply watch TV
* [jp.m3u](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadabao/iptv-org-iptv/gh-pages/countries/jp.m3u): playlist of channels you can open in mpv
* [News24](https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/share/applications/news24.desktop): watch news through mpv

### Youtube

Watching Youtube videos is a good way to learn japanese, but finding interesting channels can be hard.
See Youtube.MD for a list of the Youtube channels I follow.
