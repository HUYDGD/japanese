# Japanese Learning Resources
The best free tools and resources that I personally use to learn Japanese.<br>
[Click here](https://github.com/IgrecL/Japanese-Learning-Resources/blob/main/Ranking.md) to see a list of the specific works I read/watched, ranked by how hard they are to understand.

## Introduction

### Fundamental tools 

Most of the tools mentioned here can be used with Yomichan and Anki to create efficient flashcards.

* [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/): spaced repetition flashcards app for learning pretty much anything (vocabulary, sentence mining, grammar, etc.)
  * useful Anki addons: [AJT Furigana](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/Furigana) and [PitchAccent](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/PitchAccent)
* [Yomichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/): web browser extension for translating unknown words in web pages
  * it can be linked to Anki with AnkiConnect to generate flashcards of the words you can't read (see [here](https://animecards.site/yomichansetup/))
  * can be used to read books since .epub ebooks contain .html files

### Reading & listening material

More specific categories will be details in sections 2 to 5, but you can find most of what you're looking for on these websites:

* [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/librarymain.html): richest source of immersion material (not updated anymore :/)
* [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/): biggest torrent site for anime, manga, light novels and dramas

### Kanji

The importance of learning kanji is often underestimated. Japanese grammar highly depends on the way kanji interact, and without them you won't be able to read or watch anything.<br>
Different learning approaches exist, and all of them have their drawbacks. My take on kanji is that learning them independantly is useful at first, but it soon becomes a waste of time; I learned them mainly through immersion.

* [WaniKani](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1609000301): famous method of learning based on mnemonics (for beginners)
* [RTK (Remembering The Kanji)](https://mega.nz/folder/SkUABA5Q#4DT43HxP5vZi1pVq44_TVQ): more agressive method (but probably faster)
* [Kanji Damage](https://www.kanjidamage.com/): learning kanji with yo mama jokes
* [Kanji no Yomi](https://github.com/IgrecL/KanjiNoYomi) : a tool I created to review kanji on'yomi

### Grammar

Famous Japanese grammar books aimed at foreigners (Minna no Nihongo, Genki, etc.) teach Japanese grammar in a weird order in my opinion. I would say that learning grammar combining different guides is the best way to understand it completely (and of course immersion).

* [Tae Kim's Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar): highly regarder free guide
* [Minna no Nihongo](https://learnjapaneseaz.com/vocabulary-for-minna-no-nihongo-1.html): book often used in Japanese class all around the world
* [GENKI](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/): another famous grammar book

### Dictionaries

Buying a physical Japanese dictionary isn't really necessary; a lot of great dictionaries can be found online. Here are the ones I use.

* [Jisho](https://jisho.org/): rich Japanese-English dictionary
* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/): very detailed information for kanji lookup
* [JapanDict](https://www.japandict.com/): dictionary and details on kanji
* [日仏辞典](https://www.dictionnaire-japonais.com/): Japanese-French dictionary
* [OJAD](https://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/search/): pitch accent dictionary (advanced)

### Yomichan

A beginner has to start with a bilingual dictionary, such as JMdict (English) Alternate.<br>
However, you should switch to monolingual dictionaries as soon as possible, because it helps understanding nuances and forces you not to rely on another language. See [here](https://learnjapanese.moe/monolingual/) for a more detailed explanation.

My config file for Yomichan can be found in this repository.<br>
The dictionaries I use are in ["Dictionaries" folder](https://github.com/IgrecL/Japanese-Learning-Resources/tree/main/Dictionaries). (other dictionaries can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tTdLppnqMfVC5otPlX_cs4ixlIgjv_lH))

The priority order of monolingual dictionaries I use:
1. 旺文社国語辞典 第十一版 画像無し: concise and very simple definitions
2. 明鏡国語辞典: simple definitions too
3. 大辞林 第三版: contains many entries and remains quite simple
4. 実用日本語表現辞典: for expressions
5. 精選版 日本国語大辞典: the biggest Japanese dictionary in existence (fallback dictionary)


## ① Learning through reading

### Tools 

Reading is the best way to learn vocabulary, grammar and kanji at the same time. Most of my Japanese comes from reading novels, articles and web pages. However, reading raw content is harsh, but these tools can make it easier.

[Mokuro.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99618877/197377340-e298d29b-0657-4340-95dc-33b06c484500.webm)

* [Manga OCR](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr): great optical character recognition tool
* [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro): tool based on Manga OCR, used to turn manga pages into .html files you can look up with Yomichan
* [縦書き頑張ってみるよ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/%E7%B8%A6%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E9%A0%91%E5%BC%B5%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%BF%E3%82%8B%E3%82%88verticallineviewer/): Firefox addon turn horizontal text into vertical text (like in real Japanese books)
* [Hibiscus](http://read.hibiscus.moe/): .epub online reader implementing vertical reading
* [ッツ Ebook Reader](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/manage): same as Hibiscus
* [Jidoujisho](https://github.com/lrorpilla/jidoujisho): Android app to read books and manga with Yomichan-like translation, also with Anki integration (and a lot of other things)

### Manga

Manga are pretty hard to read at first, because sentences are shorts and sometime use very specific vocabulary.

* [Itazuraneko Manga](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/manga.html): a lot of raw manga
* [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi): you can bulk download japanes manga through Tachiyomi and export them to your computer afterwards

### Books

In my opinion, reading books is the best way of enhancing your understanding of Japanese grammar and discovering a lot of words. Unlike reading manga, you don't get extra information from the drawings, and the sentences are more advanced and formal. The good news is that books are pretty easy to find.<br>
I recommend having an English translation of the book you're reading, alongside the Japanese version. Advanced Japanese syntax can be quite confusing, and you may think you understood the meaning of a sentence when in reality you mistook a grammatical form for another.

* [Aozora Bunko](https://mega.nz/file/QIgWWLZI#HA5saYu51Gu6h23VLbysIMJ9Lms-RV5EIa19Q8kXApU): ~15,000 royalty-free Aozora Bunko books
* [Itazuraneko Books](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/shousetu.html): all kinds of Japanese books (even more than Aozora Bunko)
* [Z-Lib](https://z-lib.org/): biggest online library (not only Japanese)
* [Imperial Library](http://kx5thpx2olielkihfyo4jgjqfb7zx7wxr3sd4xzt26ochei4m6f7tayd.onion/): if Z-Lib is down [tor]


## ② Learning through listening

### Tools

You can set up mpvacious and Yomichan to generate vocab Anki cards with the context sentence, both in Japanese and translated in English, with the audio of the line, a screenshot of the scene and a definition of the word (or a translation)

[Example.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99618877/197393339-cc4f94df-75bc-49ce-9fde-dc6f3a49e084.webm)

* [Mpvacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious): mpv extension to use Yomichan on video subtitles, with Anki integration
  * if you are on Wayland you'll need wl-clipboard
* [Jidoujisho](https://github.com/lrorpilla/jidoujisho): can also be used to watch videos with translatable subtitles and Anki integration

### Subtitles

Japanese subtitles for specific shows can be really hard to find or even unavailable (e.g. Ashita no Joe). If what you are looking for can't be found in theses lists, it probably doesn't exist.

* [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F): updated collection
* [Itazuraneko Subtitles](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/sub.html): old but very rich collection
* [Tatsumoto's List](https://gist.github.com/tatsumoto-ren/78ba4e5b7c53c7ed2c987015fa05cc2b): list of subtitles collections (Tatsumoto's Guide)
* [Netflix](https://mega.nz/folder/2H4CFQYR#bd9LHl9VOqdT3crrJa0Axw): very long list of subtitles ripped from Netflix
* [Japanese Movies](https://github.com/eurusdagr/Japanese-Movies-Subtitles): subtitles for Japanese movies, ordered by directors

### Streaming

I personally never use streaming websites for learning. Downloading what you consume makes learning easier, as you can use all kinds of tools that only work on files on your computer. However, I used to do so at first, so here are the best ones I found for anime:

* [Animelon](https://animelon.com/): Japanese and English subtitles available
* [Zoro.to](https://zoro.to/): you can turn off the English subtitles, but no Japanese subs

### TV

I rarely watch TV but there are lots of way to do it.

* [AS Stream](https://aqstream.com/): simply watch TV
* [jp.m3u](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadabao/iptv-org-iptv/gh-pages/countries/jp.m3u): playlist of channels you can open in mpv
* [News24](https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/share/applications/news24.desktop): watch news through mpv

### Youtube

Watching Youtube videos is a good way to learn japanese, but finding interesting channels can be hard.

* see [Youtube.md](https://github.com/IgrecL/Japanese-Learning-Resources/blob/main/Youtube.md) for a list of interesting Youtube channels


## ③ Other ways

### Games 

There aren't any tools like Mokuro or Mpvacious for games (of course), but it doesn't mean that it's impossible. Playing games where you have to understand the story to progress is best. 

* [Manga OCR](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr): can also be used on games if you play them on PC (via emulation if not available on PC)
* [ROMs](https://r-roms.github.io/): mega-thread for ROMs
* [Emulators on Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Video_game_platform_emulators#Nintendo): for Arch users
* [VNs on Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_games#Visual_novels): I don't play VNs but yeah

### Audiobooks

Audiobooks and podcasts are for more advanced learners. Having a visual support is easier for learning.

* [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/library/onsei.html): I don't listen to audiobooks but Itazuraneko has a lot

## Random statistics

* [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io/): gives an estimation of the level needed to read/watch given works
* [Kanji Frequency](https://scriptin.github.io/kanji-frequency/): kanji usage frequency
* [Aozora Bunko stats](https://core6000.neocities.org/aozora/): number of kanji needed to read Aozora Bunko novels
  * you need to know 7744 to be able to read all of them

It's often said that knowing 500 kanji gives you 80% comprehension, 1000 kanji 95% comprehension and 2000 kanji 98% comprehension. Even though 95% sounds like a lot, it still means that you don't understand 1 word out of 20 (more or less according to the level of what you are reading). These texts, imitating what happens when reading a Japanese text with those 3 levels of kanji, help understand the importance of learning them:
